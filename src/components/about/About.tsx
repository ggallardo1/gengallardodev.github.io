            <div className="text-xl">
                <p>Iâ€™m a passionate fullstack developer with a strong focus on building robust and scalable systems. My passion lies in optimizing performance and ensuring seamless data integration, so users enjoy a smooth experience. The technologies I work with are PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS, MySQL with focus on the following frameworks, Laravel, Symfony, Wordpress, ReactJs, VueJs, Node and Express.</p>
                <br/><p>I love working on new technologies whenever there is opportunity. Since I'm coming from a <strong className="text-slate-500">&lt;career break&gt;</strong>, I wouldn't mind retooling and upskilling to new technologies. I have interest in working on Shopify, React, Ruby on Rails and Go. I'm also interested to work on ff projects: web3, blockchain, and AI Machine Learning.</p>
                <br/><p>When I am not writing code, I am probably out riding a motorcycle or playing with my little daughters at home.</p>
